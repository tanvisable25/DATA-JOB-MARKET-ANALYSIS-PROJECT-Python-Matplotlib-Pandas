# DATA-JOB-MARKET-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
Data Job Market Analysis (Python Project)

S — Situation:
The data analytics job market is constantly evolving, and understanding which skills are in high demand or command higher salaries can be confusing for analysts planning their career path.

T — Task:
Analyze the INDIA data job market dataset from Luke Barousse’s Python Course to identify trends, top-paying skills, and the most in-demand tools for data analyst roles.

A — Action:

Collected and cleaned job market data using Pandas.

Filtered the dataset for U.S.-based roles and performed analysis on job titles, salaries, and required skills.

Visualized trends and salary distributions using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Created multiple Jupyter notebooks focusing on skill demand, salary trends, and optimal skill combinations (high demand & high pay).

Used GitHub for version control and project documentation.

R — Result:

Found that SQL and Excel remain the most demanded skills, while Python, Tableau, and Oracle are among the highest-paying.

Identified an optimal mix of high-demand and high-paying skills for data analysts.

Delivered actionable insights for aspiring analysts to focus on the most valuable skills in the job market.
